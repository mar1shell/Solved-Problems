# Is Linked List Length Even?

Given a linked list, your task is to complete the function `isLengthEven()` which contains the head of the linked list, and check whether the length of the linked list is even or not. Return `true` if it is even, otherwise `false`.

## Examples:

Input: Linked list: 12->52->10->47->95->0

Output: `true`
Explanation: The length of the linked list is 6 which is even, hence returned `true`.

Input: Linked list: 9->4->3

Output: `false`
Explanation: The length of the linked list is 3 which is odd, hence returned `false`.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

## Constraints:
- 1 <= number of nodes <= 105
- 1 <= elements of the linked list <= 105
