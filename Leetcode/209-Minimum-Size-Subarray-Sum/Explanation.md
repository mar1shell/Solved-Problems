# Intuition
To find the minimum length of a subarray with a sum greater than or equal to the target, we use the sliding window technique. This technique helps efficiently find the smallest subarray by dynamically adjusting the window size based on the current sum.

# Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - Two pointers, `i` and `j`, are used to denote the start and end of the sliding window.
   - `sum` keeps track of the sum of the current window.
   - `minLength` is initialized to `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of the array. This ensures that any valid subarray length will be smaller.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving `j` to the right and add `nums[j]` to `sum` while `sum` is less than `target`.
   - Once `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, update `minLength` with the minimum value between `minLength` and the current window size (`j - i`).
   - Contract the window from the left by moving `i` to the right and subtracting `nums[i]` from `sum`, continuing this process until `sum` is less than `target` again.
   - If `sum` is still less than `target` and `j` has reached the end, increment `j` to try expanding the window further.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all elements, return `minLength` if it is less than or equal to `n`; otherwise, return `0` indicating no valid subarray was found.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input array. Each element is processed at most twice, once by the `j` pointer and once by the `i` pointer.
- **Space complexity**: $$O(1)$$. No additional space is used apart from a few variables.
