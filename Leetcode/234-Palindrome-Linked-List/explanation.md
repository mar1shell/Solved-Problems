## Intuition
To determine if a linked list is a palindrome, we can split it into two halves, reverse the second half, and then compare it to the first half. If both halves match, the list is palindromic.

## Approach
1. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the list is empty or has only one node, it’s trivially a palindrome, so we return `true`.

2. **Finding the Middle**:
   - Using two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, where `fast` moves twice as fast as `slow`, we can find the midpoint of the list. By the time `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.

3. **Reversing the Second Half**:
   - Starting from `slow`, we reverse the second half of the list. This makes it easy to compare the values from the start with the reversed second half.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the values of nodes in the first half with the nodes in the reversed second half. If all pairs match, the list is a palindrome.

5. **Restoring the List (Optional)**:
   - To preserve the original list structure, we reverse the second half back to its original order after the comparison.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of nodes in the list. We traverse the list multiple times—once to find the midpoint, once to reverse the second half, and once to compare the halves.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(1)$$, as we only use a few pointers without any extra space proportional to the list size.
