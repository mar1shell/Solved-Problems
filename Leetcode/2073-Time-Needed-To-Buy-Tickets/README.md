# 2195. Time Needed to Buy Tickets

---

There are `n` people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the `0th` person is at the **front** of the line and the `(n - 1)th` person is at the **back** of the line.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tickets` of length `n` where the number of tickets that the `ith` person would like to buy is `tickets[i]`.

Each person takes **exactly 1 second** to buy a ticket. A person can only buy **1 ticket at a time** and has to go back to **the end** of the line (which happens **instantaneously**) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will **leave** the line.

Return the **time taken** for the person **initially** at position **k******(0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

  * The queue starts as [2,3,_2_], where the kth person is underlined.
  * After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [3,_2_ ,1] at 1 second.
  * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [_2_ ,1,2] at 2 seconds.
  * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1,2,_1_] at 3 seconds.
  * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [2,_1_] at 4 seconds. Note: the person at the front left the queue.
  * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [_1_ ,1] at 5 seconds.
  * Continuing this process, the queue becomes [1] at 6 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 6.



**Example 2:**

**Input:** tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

  * The queue starts as [_5_ ,1,1,1], where the kth person is underlined.
  * After the person at the front has bought a ticket, the queue becomes [1,1,1,_4_] at 1 second.
  * Continuing this process for 3 seconds, the queue becomes [_4]_ at 4 seconds.
  * Continuing this process for 4 seconds, the queue becomes [] at 8 seconds. The kth person has bought all their tickets, so return 8.



 

**Constraints:**

  * `n == tickets.length`
  * `1 <= n <= 100`
  * `1 <= tickets[i] <= 100`
  * `0 <= k < n`
