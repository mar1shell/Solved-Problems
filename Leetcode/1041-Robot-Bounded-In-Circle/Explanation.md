# Intuition
The problem asks if a robot will remain within a bounded circle after following a sequence of instructions repeatedly. The instructions are repeated infinitely, and the robot can either move straight (`'G'`) or turn left (`'L'`) or right (`'R'`).

The key observation here is that:
1. If after executing one full cycle of instructions, the robot returns to the starting point `(0, 0)`, then it will keep looping within a bounded area.
2. If the robot does not return to the origin but does not face north at the end of the cycle, it will eventually loop back to the origin because its path will change direction after repeating the instructions.
3. If the robot finishes a cycle without being back at the origin and is still facing north, it will continue moving away indefinitely.

# Approach
1. **Direction Representation**: 
   We use complex numbers to represent the direction. Initially, the robot faces north, represented as `1j` (the imaginary unit in Python).
   - Multiplying by `1j` turns the robot 90 degrees to the left.
   - Multiplying by `-1j` turns the robot 90 degrees to the right.

2. **Position Tracking**:
   The robot's position is represented by a list `[x, y]` where:
   - Moving in the current direction increments the position based on the real and imaginary parts of the complex number representing the direction.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If the robot's final position after one cycle is the origin, return `True` (it forms a loop).
   - If the robot is not facing north at the end of the cycle, it will eventually loop back to the origin (so we return `True`).
   - If the robot ends the cycle still facing north but not at the origin, it will move further away indefinitely, so return `False`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of instructions. We iterate through the instructions exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: $$O(1)$$, as we only use a few variables to track direction and position.
