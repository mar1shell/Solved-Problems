# 1500. Count Largest Group

---

You are given an integer `n`.

We need to group the numbers from `1` to `n` according to the sum of its digits. For example, the numbers 14 and 5 belong to the **same** group, whereas 13 and 3 belong to **different** groups.

Return the number of groups that have the largest size, i.e. the **maximum** number of elements.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    **Input:** n = 13
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
    [1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
    There are 4 groups with largest size.

**Example 2:**
    
    **Input:** n = 2
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 104`
