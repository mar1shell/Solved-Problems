# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

---

## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**  
`nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`4`  
**Explanation:**  
The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Therefore, its length is `4`.

---

### Example 2

**Input:**  
`nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]`  
**Output:**  
`9`

---

### Example 3

**Input:**  
`nums = [1, 0, 1, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`3`

---

## Constraints

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
