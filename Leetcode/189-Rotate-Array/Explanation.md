# Intuition
To rotate the array by `k` steps, instead of moving elements one by one, we can leverage the reverse operation, which helps us to efficiently rearrange the elements.

# Approach
The idea is to reverse different sections of the array in such a way that the final rotated version appears correctly. We follow these steps:
1. Reverse the entire array: This flips the entire array so the last element becomes the first one and so on.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements: This brings the first `k` elements back into their correct position.
3. Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements: This brings the rest of the array (after the first `k` elements) back into their correct position.

By applying the reverse operation in these specific steps, the array is rotated by `k` steps without needing any extra space.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Each reverse operation takes O(n), where n is the size of the array. We perform three reverse operations, so the time complexity is **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity**: Since we are only using a constant amount of extra space (no additional arrays or data structures), the space complexity is **O(1)**.
