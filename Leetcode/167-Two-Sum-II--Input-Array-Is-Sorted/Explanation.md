# Intuition
The problem requires finding two numbers in a sorted array that add up to a given target. Since the array is sorted, we can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find the two numbers.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Two Pointers:** Start with two pointers: one at the beginning (`i`) and one at the end (`j`) of the array.
2. **Iterate and Compare:** Use a while loop to iterate until the two pointers meet:
   - **Sum Comparison:** Calculate the sum of the elements pointed to by `i` and `j`.
   - **Adjust Pointers:** If the sum is less than the target, increment the `i` pointer to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the `j` pointer to decrease the sum.
   - **Match Found:** If the sum equals the target, return the 1-based indices of the two numbers.
3. **Return Result:** If no match is found (though the problem guarantees one), return an empty result.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$, where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array. The two-pointer approach ensures that each element is checked at most once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$. The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for the result vector.
