# 4179. Largest Even Number

---

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'1'` and `'2'`.

You may delete any number of characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Return the **largest possible resultant string** that represents an **even** integer. If there is no such string, return the empty string `""`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "1112"

**Output:** "1112"

**Explanation:**

The string already represents the largest possible even number, so no deletions are needed.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "221"

**Output:** "22"

**Explanation:**

Deleting `'1'` results in the largest possible even number which is equal to 22.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:**

There is no way to get an even number.

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 100`
  * `s` consists only of the characters `'1'` and `'2'`.
