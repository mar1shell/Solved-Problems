# 14. Longest Common Prefix

Write a function that finds the longest common prefix string among an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, the function should return an empty string `""`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

Input: `strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]`

Output: `"fl"`

**Example 2:**

Input: `strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]`

Output: `""`

Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

## Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 200
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
- strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.
