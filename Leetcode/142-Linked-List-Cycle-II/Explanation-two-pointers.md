# Explanation

## Intuition
To find the starting point of a cycle in a linked list, we can use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which employs two pointers moving at different speeds. If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet. Once they meet, we can reset one pointer to the head and move both pointers one step at a time to find the start of the cycle.

## Approach
1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
    - We start with two pointers, `temp1` (fast) and `temp2` (slow), both pointing to the head of the linked list.
  
2. **Detecting the Cycle**:
    - We move `temp1` two steps at a time (`temp1 = (temp1->next)->next`) and `temp2` one step at a time (`temp2 = temp2->next`).
    - If `temp1` and `temp2` meet, a cycle exists. If `temp1` reaches the end of the list (`nullptr`), there is no cycle, and we return `nullptr`.

3. **Finding the Start of the Cycle**:
    - Once `temp1` and `temp2` meet, we reset `temp1` to the head of the list.
    - We then move both `temp1` and `temp2` one step at a time until they meet again. The node where they meet is the start of the cycle.
    - Finally, return the node where `temp1` and `temp2` meet, which is the starting point of the cycle.

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - If the list is empty or has only one node without a cycle, the function will return `nullptr`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. The two-pointer technique ensures that the cycle detection and the search for the cycle's start node are linear operations.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we only use a fixed amount of extra space (two pointers).
